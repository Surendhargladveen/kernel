# kernel
kernel is computer program at the core of the computer's Operating System that always has complete control over everything in a Computer.
It manages how programs use hardware and prevents conflicts between them, ensuring smooth operation and communication between software and hardware.
A full kernel manages all hardware resources using **device drivers** and resolves process conflicts over these resources. It optimizes CPU, cache, file systems, and network usage. The kernel is one of the first programs loaded at startup(after the bootloader) and handles system initialization, memory, peripherals, and I/O requests, converting them into CPU instructions.

 # How kernel Communicate with Hardware and Software
### 1. **Device Drivers** (Hardware Control)  
   - The kernel uses **device drivers** to communicate with hardware like keyboards, printers, and storage devices.  
   - When software needs to use a device, it sends a request to the kernel, which passes it to the appropriate driver.  

### 2. **Process Management** (Running Programs Smoothly)  
   - The kernel manages multiple programs running at the same time.  
   - It decides which process gets CPU time and ensures no program disrupts another.  

### 3. **Memory Management** (Efficient RAM Usage)  
   - The kernel allocates memory to programs and ensures they don’t overwrite each other’s data.  
   - It uses techniques like **virtual memory** to optimize RAM usage.  

### 4. **File System Management** (Data Handling)  
   - The kernel controls how data is read, written, and stored on disk.  
   - It ensures files are accessed securely and efficiently.  

### 5. **Interrupt Handling** (Quick Response to Events)  
   - When hardware (e.g., keyboard, mouse) or software needs attention, it sends an **interrupt** to the CPU.  
   - The kernel processes these interrupts to ensure timely responses.  

### 6. **System Calls** (Bridging Software and Hardware)  
   - Applications use **system calls** to request services like file access, network communication, or memory allocation.  
   - The kernel receives these requests, processes them, and provides the required service.  

By handling these tasks efficiently, the kernel keeps the system **stable, secure, and responsive**.

### **The kernel is stored on disk but runs in RAM while the system is active.**
 
1. **Stored on Disk** (Before Booting)  
   - The kernel is a program, so it is initially **stored on the disk** (hard drive or SSD).  

2. **Loaded into RAM** (During Booting)  
   - When you turn on your computer, the **bootloader** (like GRUB for Linux) loads the **kernel into RAM** because it needs to run continuously.  

3. **Runs in Memory (RAM)**  
   - Once loaded, the kernel stays in **RAM** and manages hardware, processes, memory, and input/output operations.  

### **Why?**  
- The kernel needs to be **fast and responsive**, so it must run from **RAM** instead of slow disk storage.  
- It remains in memory **as long as the computer is on**.  

kernel is stored in a protected memory area called kernel space.
Kernel space is located in a reserved portion of the system’s memory (RAM)
